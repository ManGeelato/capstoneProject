Shopping Cart Project with HTML, CSS and Javascript
This project allows to capture products that a user add to a cart and displays a list of products on a page
I used local storage to store the products so even if user goes to another page, their information is never lost
Contents include,  a homepage, a about us page,  a catalogue page, a shipping page and a javascript file
To install and run this project, you need to install node JS on your machine, potentially LTS version, you need Visual Studio code and Google Chrome, so you can 
see your local storage items
